Skännerite tüübid
Lameskänner - Depending on its size, a flatbed scanner can fit standard or legal-size documents. The flexible cover allows you to scan large items such as books.
Raamatuskänner – Book scanning or book digitization (also: magazine scanning or magazine digitization) is the process of converting physical books and magazines into digital media such as images, electronic text, or electronic books (e-books) by using an image scanner. Large scale book scanning projects have made many books available online. 
Fotoskänner- Many all-purpose scanners scan photos, so you don't need a separate device to handle your photographs. A photo scanner is a better deal if you only use a scanner to digitize film negatives or slides. However, it may be more expensive than an all-purpose scanner.
Kaasaskantav skänner - Portable scanners are small enough to bring on the road. Some are small enough to put in a pocket. Portable pen scanners are a bit larger than fountain pens and scan the text of a document line by line.
3D skänner - 3D scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object or environment to collect three dimensional data of its shape and possibly its appearance (e.g. color). The collected data can then be used to construct digital 3D models.
Käsiskänner -  on elektrooniline seade, mida kasutatakse füüsiliste dokumentide skannimiseks digitaalsesse vormingusse. Seda saab seega digitaalses võrgus digitaalselt salvestada, redigeerida, edastada või meilida.
